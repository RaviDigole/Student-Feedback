               <br>The Online Student Feedback System is a web-based platform designed to stream lineand automate the 
                collection of feedback from students regarding faculty performance. Traditionally,educational institutions 
                rely on manual, paper-based feedback systems, whicharetime-consuming and prone to human error. 
                This project addresses these challenges by providingasecure, efficient, and accessible digital solution that 
                enhances the feedback process, allowingreal-time data collection, reporting, and analysis
              <p> <br>The Online Student Feedback System comprises three primary modules—Student, Faculty, andAdmin—each 
                with distinct functionalities. The Student Module allows students to login, accessfaculty-specific feedback
                 forms, and submit evaluations on a five-point scale. The Faculty Module enables faculty members to view 
                 aggregated feedback data to understand their performance and areas needing improvement. The Admin Module 
                 provides administrativecontrol, allowing authorized users to manage student and faculty accounts, monitor 
                 feedbackdata, and generate reports for institutional use.</br></p> 
                 <p><br>Developed for the Department of Emerging Science and Technology at Maharashtra Institute of Technology by Ravi Digole & TEAM , this system is intended to support both students and faculty in fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Students can log in to the system and provide detailed feedback on various aspects of teaching, which is then stored securely in a central database. The system uses structured feedback forms with standardized questions to ensure consistency in the data collected. Faculty members and administrators can then review this feedback to gain insights into teaching performance and identify areas for professional development. </p>
                 <P><br>This project is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, PHP for server-side scripting, and MySQL as the database management system, all hosted on alocal XAMPP server. This combination ensures ease of deployment, scalability, and an accessible interface that meets the needs of users across devices. The Online Student Feedback System represents a significant step toward a modern, digital approach to student feedback, offering a structured and reliable means to gather and analyze student opinions to enhance educational quality</P>
